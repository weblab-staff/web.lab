## class materials
- Livestream: you can use either panopto or zoom, whichever you prefer. Panopto is limited to students registered or cross-registered through the MIT registrar. (We have both options for the livestream in case we have technical issues on one platform.)
  - Panopto livestream: [weblab.is/livestream](https://weblab.is/livestream)
    - And if you're new to panopto, check out [weblab.is/panopto-guide](https://weblab.is/panopto-guide)
  - Zoom livestream: [weblab.is/zoom](https://weblab.is/zoom) will be updated with a live zoom link before class starts.
- Technical issues or got lost during a workshop? Add yourself to [weblab.is/q](https://weblab.is/q) and a staff member will come help!
- Conceptual questions? Type them on our questions doc: [weblab.is/questions](https://weblab.is/questions)! Staff literally sit on the doc waiting for questions, so don't be shy.
- Give us feedback! It's so helpful: [weblab.is/feedback](https://weblab.is/feedback)
- Want to know what we're serving for lunch? Our ops chairs will keep [weblab.is/food](https://weblab.is/food) up-to-date with the menu as they finalize it.
  - Make sure we know about your dietary restrictions [here](https://forms.gle/PK3zXBWM653Bth6i7)
- All the slides in one place: [weblab.is/slides](https://weblab.is/slides).
- Recordings will be uploaded to [weblab.is/youtube](https://weblab.is/youtube) as soon as we can prepare them. That's typically before the end of the day the lectures were given.
